# Improving Predictive Models for Online Education

**Project Description:**

The project, titled "Enhancing Predictive Models for Online Education," is a comprehensive exploration of machine learning techniques applied to online education platforms. Developed as the final project for CSC311 Winter 2023, the project delves into predicting students' correctness in answering diagnostic questions based on their historical responses and metadata.

**Objective:**
The primary objective of the project is to improve predictive models used in online education platforms. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, the project aims to enhance the accuracy and effectiveness of assessing students' understanding of course materials.

**Key Tasks:**
1. **Algorithm Application and Comparison:** The project begins by applying various machine learning algorithms, including k-Nearest Neighbor, Item Response Theory, Matrix Factorization, Neural Networks, and Ensemble methods, to predict students' correctness in answering diagnostic questions.
2. **Algorithm Modification:** In the second part of the project, participants propose modifications to existing algorithms to improve their predictive performance. This involves a rigorous analysis of factors influencing model performance and implementing innovative solutions to enhance accuracy.
3. **Evaluation and Analysis:** Throughout the project, participants evaluate the performance of their models using validation and test datasets. Detailed analyses are conducted to compare the efficacy of different algorithms and modifications, considering factors such as prediction accuracy, optimization, and overfitting.
4. **Report Documentation:** The project culminates in the preparation of a comprehensive report documenting the methodologies, findings, and insights gained. The report includes formal descriptions of algorithm extensions, diagrams illustrating model architectures, comparisons with baseline models, demonstrations of experimental results, and discussions on limitations and potential extensions.

**Dataset:**
The project utilizes a subsampled dataset provided by Eedi, an online education platform offering mathematical diagnostic questions for students aged 7 to 18. The dataset includes information on student responses, question metadata, and student metadata, facilitating the training and evaluation of predictive models.

**Collaboration and Submission:**
Participants are encouraged to collaborate in teams of 2-3 members, with submissions required in the form of a final report and accompanying Python code. Collaboration is essential for leveraging diverse perspectives and expertise in tackling the project's challenges effectively.

**Expected Outcome:**
By the project's conclusion, participants gain valuable experience in applying machine learning techniques to real-world educational data. The project not only enhances technical proficiency but also fosters critical thinking, problem-solving, and collaboration skills essential for success in data analysis and machine learning roles.
